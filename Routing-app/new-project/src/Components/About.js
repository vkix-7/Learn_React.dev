            <h3>We value thoughtfulness</h3>
            <p>Thoughtfulness is embedded in our culture - even our name means 'to think'. We approach problems with the human in mind, asking: how can we help people know and do more? We're not moving fast and breaking things; we take time to consider every angle. Outcomes matter to our team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value">
            <h3>We value playfulness</h3>
            <p>We believe a child-like sense of wonder and curiosity are essential to creativity - and play is part of our product and our philosophy. Through it we see things from different angles, imagining new solutions and discovering new questions to ask.</p>

            <h3>We value purpose</h3>
            <p>Goal-oriented and outcome-led, we're optimistic about what Pienso can do for people and pragmatic about the learning curve to get there. With expertise and empathy, we guide our users to their 'eureka' moment when use becomes understanding - and we look for those moments in our own work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value">
            <h3>We value humility</h3>
            <p>We do all of the above with humility because we're always learning, too. Our customers continually surprise us with the scope of their ideas, taking Pienso places we hadn't considered ourselves. We respect the innovators who have come before us, the experts of today, and the world we're building together.</p>
